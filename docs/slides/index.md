First, I wanted to start by giving you some background of where I came from.

I'm a Staff Instructor for LinkedIn Learning and have completed over 70 courses in the library over the last few years. My specialty is front-end and full-stack development.

Before that, I was the Director of Multimedia for a company called Entravision, the larger franchisor of Univision TV Stations. They purchased a company where I worked where I built a network of radio station websites from the ground up for hispanic media in the East Coast.

I got my start on the web at Tribune Interactive, who owned the LA Times, NY Newsday, Chicago Tribune. I was a Senior Designer for their local flashship newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, I also built interactive projects, games and worked in the newsroom the Iraq War, Columbia disaster and the infamous hanging chad Bush/Gore election.

So, I have some experience building and managing a network of sites from a designer and developer perspective. I understand about design, analytics and building something from the ground up. At Entravision, we built and managed our own social platform and had radio streaming more than a decade ago.

Here's some of my current numbers for the LinkedIn platform. I have over 18k followers. I have a highly focused audience targeting front end and full stack developers, which are the topics I cover at LinkedIn. I grew that from less than 1000 connections I had when I joined LinkedIn.

I recently started a weekly newsletter using the LinkedIn tools that has more 10k subscribers. So far, I've published 14 editions. I got about 5,000 subscribers of them the first week. I've published 14 editions which garnered 1200+ reactions and 160+ comments.

Since I got access to LinkedIn Live, I've published 18 Live Streams. 10 episodes of a Podcast series called Not A Podcast with other LinkedIn Learning authors, I'm doing one regular monthly livestream called 'The Launch'. That's a 'Grand Opening' style celebration of a course release, I create events for the streams with hundredths of attendees and thousands of watches.

I've done lots of additional experimental livestreams like 'The Recap', which is a review of a Tech event like Github's last Universe conference as well livestream tips and Q&A episodes.

# Getting<br>Started

- Joined with **Lynda** Acquisition
  - Used LinkedIn for Resume
  - Less than **1000 followers**
- Started posting to feed semi-regularly
  - 24 Newsletter articles
  - **6950** reactions
  - **584** Comments
  - **113,974** Views
- Enjoyed some success with articles and engagement

> >

When I joined LinkedIn with the Lynda acquisition, I didn't use it as a social platform.

Like many people, I saw it as a great place to host my resume, but not necessarily a place to engage with an audience. There were few tools besides the stream to engage.

At the time I had less than 1000 followers, but I realized that I needed to explore what the platform could do to connect with my audience and learn about how the platform could be leveraged for authors.

I got started by posting things to the platform irregularly.

I started posting Newsletter article, with some success, but it was inconsistent, so I stopped publishing regularly. My lowest article got 473 views, while my highest rated article got 28,526 views. Overall the effort seemed inconsistent and I couldn't find a

Articles were just opening up as a viable way to publish long form content, so I started writing articles with some irregular degree of success.

# The Gold Mine

- Greater followers on LinkedIn
  - **7300** Followers on LinkedIn
  - **7200** Followers on Twitter
- Results
  - Much higher engagement
  - Better threading/editing
- Video vastly **outperforms** YouTube
  - Example from **Official Github** Account
  - YouTube: **2.3k** views
  - LinkedIn: **65,540**
  - My own videos get **thousands** of views

> >

What really turned the corner for me is when a couple of years ago, I realized that my follower count at LinkedIn exceeded my Twitter numbers where I had about 7000 followers.

My posts on LinkedIn got a higher degree of engagement than anything I posted on twitter, so that really drove my adoption.

I was also able to have more meaningful conversations with better message threading and so help me...the ability to edit posts.

The other thing I noticed is how much better video performs on LinkedIn. Even though the tail is a lot shorter (the amount of time the video will show in people's timeline), video seriously outperforms what you can do on YouTube.

Take This LinkedIn Video from three weeks ago on Github Flavored Markdown. On YouTube, the video has 2.3k views. On LinkedIn the same video has 65,540 views.

LinkedIn was a goldmine. The audience is not only there, but waiting for someone to post meaningful content to engage with.

The secret was that I needed to give them reasons to engage with me and make content that made them want to come back.

# The Content Plan

- Post **2x/day weekdays**
- **Monthly/Weekly** Stream
- **Weekly** Newsletter
- 1+ **Video Tutorial** weekly
- **Engage** with Polls
- Grow audience through **connections** and **comments**
- Experiment with **Live Action**

> >

So I started to get serious and work towards a content plan to get used to publishing and figure out how to be successful in the platform.

I started by trying to post one thing per day and then when I found out how to be more efficent posting moved to two posts during weekdays, no weekend posting.

I experimented with a number of live streaming approaches and settled on a monthly special launch stream, although I am planning on moving to weekly streams as soon as I can fit it into the schedule.

I started and will continue to write a weekly newsletter called Apply, where I'm experimenting with the content type to speak more directly to my audience.

I'm creating an original video post each week with some developer tips. This requires that I do a lot of editing and graphics, but it's helping me figure out the workflow and what things resonate with my audience.

I'm also engaging daily with my audience by commenting, connecting and using the platform often.

I'm also experimenting with differet Live Action types to explore how best to utilize Live Action with our traditiona screen capture methods and also things like Github and Practice environments, Codepen, CodeSpaces, Interactivity.

# Success

- Number of **Followers**
- Amount of Newsletter<br>**Subscriptions**
- Seek **high quality** connections
  - Number of<br>**Shares/Acceleration**
  - Meaninful **comments**
  - Engagement: **Not Likes**
  - Engagement: **Likes**
- Video
  - Unique Viewers
  - Minutes Watched

> >

I wanted to share a bit about the metrics I use to gauge success and how I go about growing my audience.

First of course is the amount of followers I have on the platform. Engagement is highly correlated to the amount of followers someone has on the platform, so the quickest way to increase my success is to gain followers.

In order to grow meaningful engagement, I look for opportunities to gain high quality connections. That means connections that engage with my content. The quickest way is to connect with people who already engage with my content, because that automatically creates a follower with someone who is likely to engage.

Here's what I consider a prospects who are potential high quality connections.

The action that has the highest value is a share. Sharing means someone my content so valuable to multiply it's reach. So if someone shares my content, I connect with them.

Then, I like meaningful comments that add to the conversation or create additional comments. I'll take kudos, but they're not as good.

Next is engagement that is not a like. It meaks they had to have a bit more effort than a like.

Finally a like is better than nothing, but it doesn't really have a ton of value.

I dont necessarily just follow everyone, but focus on people who perform high quality engagements.

The metrics for video are similar, but I'm mostly interested with how quickly my audience grows. Videos seem to have a limited lifespan since they display on the feed, so how quickly I get to 1000 views seems like a good measure of how successful the video will be.

I'm also interested in how long people watch the video for. I'd like this to be a little better and like YouTube tell me when people stop watching the video.

# Challenges:<br>Aggregation

- The **more I post**,<br>the **harder it is** to<br>find older posts
- Posts have a **usable tail** of about **two weeks** long.
- After **two weeks** they have **negligible traffic**.
- Creators need tools to **aggregate content** into groups
- YouTube has **Playlists**, Facebook has **pages**. Aggregation is one of the keys to growth.

> >

I wanted to share some of the challenges I face as a creator because they might help you reinforce some of the feelings I imagine you already have about improving the platform.

First is aggregation. The LinkedIn feed behaves a lot like the twitter feed. It's great for time sensitive content. When I post, my content has a lifetime tail of about one to two weeks long. After that my posts stop getting traction.

It's extremely difficult to find or aggregate posts that I've done in the past. Once you start posting regularly, your activity in posts gets so long that it's impossible to find...say a video you did more than a week ago.

So unless I create hashtags, I can't really relate content or create a content series. So unlike YouTube where I can create playlists. It's hard to generate content that is related to one-another.

# Challenges:<br>Posting

- Posting to **multiple places** is challenging
- I have to create **multiple posts** if I want to **post to the stream** and a **group**...for example.
- I end up **not posting** to groups
- Articles have potential, but need attention. The technology hasn't grown significantly. We should seek to become the **de-facto platform** for publishing.

> >

Posting to more than one place within LinkedIn is also extremely challenging. Let's say I release a new course or a new video and I want to post it somewhere other than the feed.

LinkedIn forces me to do separate posts for each destination. So If I want to add it to different groups that I feel would find them useful, I have to create separate posts. I know this is by design, but the consequence is that I just don't bother posting news or other content to groups.

Along with groups, innovation in articles as a platform has been stagnant. The ability to create newsletters is great, but the tool iteself hasn't changed in quite a while and it suffers from the same lack of aggregation tools as the rest of the content.

# Challenges

- Posting to multiple places causes n**oise in the stream**
- Posts should have **destinations** and not show up in your stream as a **separate activity**
- Just like we allow 5 hashtags in Creator mode, **allow me to post** to at least **2 groups** in addition to the timeline.
- In addition to **articles and posts** in activity, give us **video, polls, newsletters** and other content types.

> >

This also creates a separate issue and that's of noise to my stream. My activity causes my list of posts or activity tab to get extremely messy.

I feel like a post is a post, where that post is delivered is a destination, not a separate activity.

I know this is controversial, but I want the ability to post to at least two groups and have my stream reflect the post as a single activity.

In addition to giving us access to articles and posts in our activity, find ways to give us access to polls, videos, streams, events, newsletters and other content types.

# Challenges:<br>Analytics

- Analytics **lack a homepage**. It is the **lifeblood** for creators.
- We have **good analytics**...all over the place.
- I'd like to see a **centralized page** for analysis
- I'd like **data only LinkedIn** can give us.
  - What job titles
  - skills engaged with
  - People who watched my courses
- Pages has better analytics, but not available to individuals

> >

Another huge struggle is Analytics. Creators live for analytics so they can gauge the success of their efforts. I actually love the LinkedIn analytics. They're insightful and I like some of the features not available in other platforms like the job titles and company listings, but they're not easy to find.

This is partly because the activity stream is so messy.

One place analytics is better is inside pages. I opened up a page so that I could see if the analytics were better there and sure enough, they are superior.

But pages aren't really designed around topics or to aggregate content. This is an opportunity to perhaps be more friendly to pages that are not companies. They could be topic related like Facebook and flourish to become communities.

# Challenges: <br>Stream

- **Promoting a livestream**<br>on the newsletter is<br>**challenging**
- **Don't limit** stream<br>to one week before the event
- **Few subscribers**<br>as a percentage show up.
  - Events are **not seen** by<br>the rest of my audience,<br>just people who sign up.
  - Let me create<br>**recurring events**
  - Help **translate my audience**<br>from one event to another.

> >

I'm super excited to hear that our strategy is to become OneLinkedIn. That's because right now the individual features are pretty compelling, but don't work well together.

I'll give you an example. I wanted to promote a future live stream on my newsletter. So I created an event for the stream. But when you create a stream it's limited to one week before the event. I was publishing my newsletter on Tuesdays or Wednesdays and I wanted my stream to happen Wednesday afternoon.

That meant that I either had to wait until the day of the event to put it in my newsletter or change the day I released the newsletter to six days before the event.

When you create an event, you end up getting a lot of subscribers to the events, but few of them will show up. There is little relationship between the people that sign up for the event versus the people who show up. I think a lot of people are intersted in the content, but prefer to catch it on a replay instead of live.

I also wish there was a way to create recurring events. Right now I have to create individual events. When one event is finished, you can't translate that audience to another event.

Unless you're a company. There's a way to get an email list of the attendees, but only if you're a page.

# Access

- Give creators **more access** to audience
- Encourage **different types** of connections
- Let us **leverage those connection** types
- My audience **isn't the people from work**, it's the people who want to view my content
- **Improve outreach** when generating events by letting invite a job title or skill, or someone who's watched my courses.

> >

Give creators access to their audience in different ways. I think newsletters is a great way to gather an audience, but increased notifications would be great.

You should also move towards a model that encorages different types of connections. The connection relationship is too limited. For example. I have a lot of work connections that arne't part of my audience. There's a lot of people who I work with, that wouldn't be remotely intersted about my next course release or what I had to say about React or Svelte.

When I want to promote an event, the categories for gaining users are too limiting. There should be a way to reach out to my followers by job title or what they're identified at being good at.

# Big Impact

- Focus on giving creators **access to metrics**
- Give **Creators a Homepage** other than the profile
- Improve **scheduling and exposure**
- Make it **easier to post** and everywhere including groups
- Develop a strong audience **Monetization strategy**
- Focus on helping everyone **gain an audience**

> >

One of the most valuable things you could add would be better metrics. Nothing drives engagement like measurable success. Figuring out what's successful is a lot of work.

Right now there are two homepages, the profile page for individuals and a business page for businesses. For creators, having their own space that is separate than what people associate with a job application is clearer.

Groups are great, but too hard to post into, get very spammy because anyone can just post to a group. I think perhaps you need to look at more of a facebook model with moderated groups. Those are suprisingly similar to Business Pages. They are probably close to the model that creators need with better traffic reporting.

Scheduling posts, a longer length to schedule livestreams, single posting.

Finally there's two reasons creators will post things. The first is to increase their klout and build an audience of followers that they can engage with to drive actions.

The second is that once their audience is big enough to monetize that audience to generate revenue. That's gotta be part of your long term plan, but audience first. Monetization later.
